# p5js-final-project
This project is a demonstration of what I learned using p5.js. I created a simple game where the user needs to avoid meteors for ten seconds in order to win. The meteors are ellipses that move from y=0 to y=400, then as they leave the screen their y position is set to 0 and it is given a random x postiton. The meteors also have collision methods that check to see if the meteor is touching the rocket and if it is the game is immediatly ended. The rocket follows the cursor and is made of simple shapes. The timer counts the frame rate and every 60 frames the text decreases by one number. If the timer reaches 0 then the background is set to green, the game draw method is ended and "You Win!" appears.
